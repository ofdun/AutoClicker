## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

One day I was just playing minecraft with mods and everything seemed fine, but suddenly I needed to sieve 10 stacks of gravel.
It is an easy task, you just need to hold a right mouse button, but it takes about 5 seconds to sieve one gravel and I needed to click RMB for 53,33(3) minutes and thats just hilarious.
So, I decided to create this tiny app writed on python, which helps you click almost every button on keyboard & mouse with a little of settings.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

Apps settings are so straightforward to understand.
First button stands for the key that app will click, you can rebind this key by pressing on a button and then clicking a key or mouse button.
Next to it you will see a text box containing delay between clicks.
The last text box keeps the number of seconds that app will be running.
Press start button or the bind to start.
Press stop button or the bind to stop.
You can rebind start button key with the button on the right of the stop button. ( principle is the same as that of the first button )
